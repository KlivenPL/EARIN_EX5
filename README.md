### Parameters:
```cmd

  -p, --network-path      Required. Bayesian network JSON file path

  -e, --evidence          Evidence, given in JSON object format without spaces, eg. {burglary:\"T\",alarm:\"T\"}. If defined, program expects query to be defined as well

  -m, --markov-blanket    If defined, program prints out Markov blanket for entered variable, eg. burglary

  -q, --queries           Selected query variables, eg. earthquake,John_calls

  -s, --steps             Required. The number of steps performed by MCMC algorithm

  --help                  Display this help screen.

  --version               Display version information.
```
### Example usage:
```cmd
